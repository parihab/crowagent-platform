        CrowAgent™ Platform is a physics-informed campus thermal intelligence system designed to help
        university estate managers and sustainability professionals make evidence-based, cost-effective
        decisions for achieving Net Zero targets.

        The platform combines **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** methodology with an **agentic AI
        advisor**, live **Met Office weather integration**, and structured **scenario comparison** to evaluate retrofit
        interventions across a campus portfolio.

        **Working Prototype — Indicative Results Only**
        
        CrowAgent™ Platform is currently a working research prototype. All energy, carbon, and financial
        results produced by this platform are based on simplified steady-state physics models calibrated against
        published UK higher education sector averages (HESA 2022-23, CIBSE Guide A). They do not reflect the
        specific characteristics of any real building or institution.

        **Results must not be used as the sole basis for any capital investment, procurement, or planning
        decision.** Before undertaking any retrofit programme, organisations should commission a site-specific
        energy assessment by a suitably qualified energy surveyor or building services engineer in accordance
        with BS EN ISO 52000 and relevant CIBSE guidance.

            The CrowAgent™ AI Advisor is powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**, a large language

            • Generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information ("hallucination")
